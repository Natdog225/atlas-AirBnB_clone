					This is a lovely 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom apartment that can
					comfortably accommodate 2 guests. It is located in a prime
					location, just steps away from the subway and the Zoo, there was
					once a time when someone took a few steps outside and was robbed by
					an orangutang, so one you book here you are running the possibility
					of having quite the adventure. Also I'm a beatle!

					Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guest house.
					The Feel Good Tiny House is big on comfort, small in size. It is
					a quaint, 400 square ft. full of love. Tiny House living is
					a quaint, eco-friendly way to relax, refresh, and reconnect.
					The entire house, with a bath tub in the main room, is
					spacious. The sofa converts to a bed and the loft has a very
					comfortable queen size bed. We have a full kitchen and a hard
					wood maple floor that feels warm to the feet.
