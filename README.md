# AirBnB Clone Of Fun! 

This is a simplified clone of the AirBnB platform, built with the love of two students who are
really scared to start it. So very little.

## Description

The project focuses on implementing core functionalities related to managing Airbnb entities (users, places, bookings, etc.) and storing data using a file storage system.

## Command Interpreter

* **Starting the interpreter:** `./console.py`
* **Usage:** Enter commands at the `(Welcome To "Insert Clever Name" BNB!)` prompt.
* **Examples:**
    * `help`: List available commands.
    * `quit`: Exit the interpreter.
    * `create User`: Create a new User object.
    * `show User <user_id>`: Display details of a specific User.
